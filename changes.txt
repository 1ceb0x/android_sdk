Change log for Android SDK Tools.

Revision 10:
- Default proguard config file changes:
   * ignore classes extending android.preference.Preference
   * ignore classes extending android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper
- Ant lib rules now allow for overriding java.encoding, java.source, and java.target
- Default encoding for Ant javac is now UTF-8
- Fix "folder locked" errors when installing packages in SDK Manager on Windows.

Revision 9:
- Fix packaging issue that broke draw9patch
- Ant build rules will now check the Ant version

Revision 8:
- New SDK component: platform-tools. This makes all platforms use the same
  latest version of aapt/aidl/dx.
- Support for true debug build. No need to change the value of debuggable in
  the Android Manifest.
  "ant debug" will automatically insert debuggable==true, while "ant release"
  will not.
  If debuggable=true is set, then "ant release" will actually do a debug build.
- Automatic Proguard support in release builds. Only need to have a proguard.config
  property in default.properties that points to a proguard config file.
- new overridable Ant javac properties: java.encoding, java.source, and java.target
  (default to "ascii", "1.5" and "1.5")


Revision 7:
- Support for Ant rules provided by the Tools components (override the one in
  the platform component)
- Added support for libraries with library dependencies.
- Support for aidl files in library projects.
- Support for extension targets in Ant build to perform tasks between the
  normal tasks: -pre-build, -pre-compile, -post-compile.
- Headless SDK update. See 'android -h update sdk' for more info.
- Fixed location control in DDMS to work in any locale not using '.' as a
  decimal point.
